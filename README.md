Project: Expense Tracker
Project OverviewAs we embark on Week 3 of your internship program, I am excited to introduce the project that will 
further enhance your skills in Java Programming. The upcoming task is the creation of a "Expense
Tracker" as part of your Java Programming internship.
The Expense Tracker project aims to create a robust and user-friendly application that allows users
to manage and monitor their expenses efficiently. This program will serve as a hands-on
experience in applying Java programming concepts to develop a functional and practical software
solution.
